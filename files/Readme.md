# Interactive Portfolio Website

This project is my personal interactive portfolio website, built to showcase my skills, projects, and achievements with a strong focus on **UI clarity, smooth interactions, and responsive design**.
The goal was not only to create a visually appealing site, but also to demonstrate practical frontend engineering decisions and attention to user experience.
